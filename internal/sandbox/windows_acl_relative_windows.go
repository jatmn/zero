// Handle-relative directory operations.
//
// WHY THESE EXIST. Every pathname-based call re-resolves the whole path inside
// the kernel at the moment it runs. So verifying a component and then creating
// through it are two separate resolutions of the same string, and a workspace
// owner can swap an ancestor for a junction in the gap between them: setup
// verifies, the attacker swaps, setup creates, and the object lands outside the
// approved tree. Checking again afterwards is too late, because the thing has
// already been created somewhere it should not be.
//
// A HANDLE pins the object rather than the name. Once a directory is open, that
// handle keeps referring to the same directory however the path is later
// rearranged, so creating a child relative to it cannot be redirected. os.Mkdir,
// os.OpenFile and os.RemoveAll are pathname-based by construction with no
// relative form on Windows, which is why this drops to NtCreateFile with
// OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES.RootDirectory.

// IO_STATUS_BLOCK.Information values for a create/open, named because "2 means
// it was created" is not something a reader should have to look up.
