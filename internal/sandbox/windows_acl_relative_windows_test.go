// THE SWAP THAT PATHNAMES CANNOT SURVIVE.
//
// This is the race behind the materialization P1. A pathname-based create
// resolves the whole path again at the moment it runs, so an ancestor replaced
// between the verification and the create sends the new directory somewhere else
// entirely. Verifying afterwards is too late: the object already exists in the
// wrong place.
//
// A handle pins the OBJECT, not the name. This test performs the swap for real,
// in the window that used to be exploitable, and asserts the child still lands
// in the directory that was verified.
//
// Worth noting for anyone extending this: the fix is what makes the race
// testable at all. Against the old code the swap had to be threaded into the
// middle of a function; here it is three ordinary lines between an open and a
// create, because the handle is held across them.
