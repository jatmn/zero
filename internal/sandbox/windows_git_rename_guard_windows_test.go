// The mask is the whole point of the action, so it is asserted bit by bit.

// Renaming a directory needs DELETE on the directory itself, so denying DELETE
// is what stops .git being replaced. Everything else in the mask is there to
// stop the principal removing the guard: WRITE_DAC would let it rewrite the
// DACL, WRITE_OWNER would let it take ownership and then rewrite the DACL.
//
// What must NOT be in it matters just as much. FILE_GENERIC_WRITE would stop git
// writing index, objects and refs. FILE_DELETE_CHILD would stop git deleting its
// own lock files and refs. Either one turns a rename guard into a broken repo.
