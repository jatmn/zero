package sandbox

// ACLs for a sandbox principal.
//
// The capability-SID model this sits beside starts from "the caller can already
// read everything" and narrows writes, because the sandboxed child runs as the
// caller. A principal inverts that: a separate local account has no access to
// the caller's profile at all, so the interesting direction is what to GRANT.
//
// That inversion is the point. Credential stores under the user's profile are
// unreachable because the principal is a different account, not because a deny
// rule enumerated them, which is what makes this able to close #662 and #675 on
// Windows where a deny-read ACE against the caller's own SID never could. Deny
// rules stay useful only for objects that are readable by everyone.
//
// Grants are explicit and narrow: the workspace and any extra write roots get
// read+write, declared read-only roots get read, and the protected metadata
// carve-outs the profile already defines stay denied so .git internals and
// .zero/.agents cannot be rewritten from inside the sandbox.
